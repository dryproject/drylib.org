   **Here be dragons.**
   This is a semi-public, pre-alpha, work-in-progress project.

   **Caveat utilitor:**
   Assume nothing works, and you may be pleasantly surprised;
   and when it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

**This project is presently at an early design and proof-of-concept stage.**
It is unlikely to be particularly useful as yet to anyone but its authors.

At the time of writing (summer 2018), the :doc:`C++ <cpp>`, :doc:`Go <go>`,
:doc:`Java <java>`, and :doc:`OCaml <ocaml>` ports are being actively
developed and fleshed out. In parallel, work is ongoing on a code generator
that will significantly reduce the manual work needed to port the library
to other :doc:`target languages <languages>`.

If you are interested in the project, you can keep tabs on development at
`GitHub <https://github.com/dryproject>`__ and follow `@bendiken`_ on
Twitter for project announcements.
